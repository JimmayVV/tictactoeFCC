#### Jimmy's TODO's: ####
1. ~~Finish commenting the current state of the application~~
2. ~~Convert checkWins function into a pure function, so that we can check wins against hypothetical grids, not just the current grid~~
3. ~~Convert basically everything into pure functions, using return values from the calling functions to set the main game state (if necessary)~~
4. ~~We want to be able to check hypothetical game states without screwing up our current state~~
